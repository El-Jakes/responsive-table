# responsive-table

The table comprises user data fetched from an API.
the table is responsive across all. devices

## Challenges faced
I observed the table has accessibility issues on smaller screens due to the fact that I created generic headings for smaller screens.
I'd really appreciate it if anyone could help me with a solution to how I can fix this problem.
